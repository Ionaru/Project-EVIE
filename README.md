# Evie

Project EVIE is an API data checker for the game EVE Online. it will fetch information from the EVE Online API servers and display it on the webpage.

My goal is to build a mobile-friendly website that will always display the most recent data, without the need to refresh the page each time. 

The website is created using:
- HTML5
- CSS 3
- PHP 7+
- JavaScript 3


Browser support for:
- Chrome
- Firefox
- IE9+
- Edge
- Safari
- Opera
- Android Browser

To use this website in any browser, JavaScript needs to be enabled.
