# Evie

Project EVIE is an API data checker for the game EVE Online. it will fetch information from the EVE Online API servers and display it on a webpage.
My goal is to build a mobile-friendly website that will always display the most recent available data when the page loads.


#####The website is created using:
* HTML 5
* CSS 3
* PHP 7+
* JavaScript 3


#####Libraries used:
* Bootstrap - http://getbootstrap.com/
* FontAwesome - https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/
* Jquery - https://jquery.com/
* TotalStorage - https://github.com/Upstatement/jquery-total-storage
* CountUp - https://inorganik.github.io/countUp.js/
* TimeAgo - http://timeago.yarp.com/


#####Browser support intended for:
* Chrome
* Firefox
* IE9+
* Edge
* Safari
* Opera
* Android Browsers
* ~~iOS browsers~~ (I can't do tests on iOS at this point)

To use this website in any browser, JavaScript needs to be enabled.
